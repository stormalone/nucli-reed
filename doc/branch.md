### integrate_nucompleter

This is a branch off of variable_completer... and we clean up and add
shell.rs

### variable_completer

This brings buffer.rs into the mix which is a replacement for script.rs
with the same interface as process_script.

### nu-completer

This brings the nu-completer crate into the repository so local
changes can be made to this crate outside of the release.
