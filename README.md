### Integrate reedline into nushell

Use [reedline](https://github.com/jonathandturner/reedline) and replace rustyline...

### Build Details

So every time a new release of nushell comes out
I will branch off main and create a build.

There are 2 crates in this repo...

  * nu-cli
  * reedline

Cargo.toml keys off the release builds.
